# Roadmap

## 2.0

### Tests

- Submit value with non-ascii / unicode characters. e.g. CJK.

### API

- Rename a mailing list
- View or remove pending subscription subscribers
- Able to update parameter for ALL accounts under same domain.

### Web Interface

Since mlmmj supports management by sending emails to particular addresses
(e.g. `list+unsubscribe@domain.com`, `list+owner@domain.com`), web
interface is not so urgent.

- Allow moderators to manage mailing list profiles
- Allow end users to manage their own subscriptions
- Custom skel template files
- Deploy with Nginx with https support

## 3.0: Archive

- Write scripts to convert archived emails of public mailing list to web pages.
- Support multiple list addresses.
